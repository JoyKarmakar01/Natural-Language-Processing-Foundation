    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "This code uses TextBlob, a simple NLP library, to perform sentiment analysis. It calculates the polarity (positive or negative sentiment) and subjectivity (personal opinion or factual information) of the sample text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "NER, POS tagging, and sentiment analysis are essential NLP tasks with numerous practical applications. They enable machines to understand and process human language, enhancing various applications from customer support to market analysis and beyond."
